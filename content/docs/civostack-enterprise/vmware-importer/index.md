## Introduction

Migrating VMware Instances to Civo has never been this simple.

We created a tool, a VMware Importer, which helps you migrate your VMware instances with ease using out 3 different import methods:

- [Import from ESXi](./import-from-esxi.md): Import VMs directly from ESXi by connecting to your remote VMware ESXi server. 
- [Upload an Image from your local device](./upload-image-from-local-device.md): Migrate your VM by providing a local VMDK file to be connected to a live Civo Instance.
- [Custom Import](./custom-import.md): Provide a HTTPs URL directly to the VMDK file you would like to import into Civo. 
- API Integration - Coming soon

With our instant migration magic: move your VMware to Civo in Minutes!
