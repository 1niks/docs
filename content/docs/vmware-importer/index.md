## VMware Importer introduction

Migrating VMware Instances to Civo has never been this simple.

We created a tool, a VMware Importer, which helps you migrate your VMware instances with ease using out 3 different import methods:

- Import from ESXi: Import VMs directly from ESXi by connecting to your remote VMware ESXi server. 
- Upload an image from your local device: Migrate your VM by providing a local VMDK file to be connected to a live Civo Instance.
- HTTPS Import: Provide a HTTPS URL directly to the VMDK file you would like to import into Civo. 
- API Integration - Coming soon

With our instant migration magic: move your VMware to Civo in Minutes!
